##Executive Summary

The reason for the motivation of this system is to give the ability to the Developer and/or Manager (technically the company) to check for Open Source Software Licenses/Vulnerabilities to prevent them from being at risk from legal or system wide issues. Without a system implementation of scanning of vulnerabilites or licenses this could mean the future of this company. This system also provides efficiency, the sooner this information is checked and verified the quicker the execution of the project. 


This system allows Developers to check a Software Package to a National Institute of Standards and Technology database that is scanned to check for vulnerabilities and licenses. The scanned information is then stored into OSS database that can be accessed by the manager and/or the developer at any time. Once they have the information of the NIST database they(developer and manager) can check it with the corporate OSS Package policy database in order to finalize for implementation. The manager is also able to create/modify/update policy documents at any time.
